		<h3>The Client</h3>
		<p>Olde City Candle Company, a local artisan candlemaker.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>Olde City’s candles had been selling wonderfully at the local flea market, and after many inquiries from customers were ready to bring their business online. Having little to no experience working on the web, the resulting site had to be easy to use for both their staff and scent-loving shoppers!</p>

	<section>
			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>Reflecting their country roots with splashes of plaid and wood, their e-commerce website is uncluttered and easy to navigate while still offering plenty of opportunity to showcase Olde City’s products.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
			<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
			<p>X-Cart, HTML, CSS</p>
