		<h3>The Client</h3>
		<p>Animal Emergency Hospital is a full-service emergency veterinary clinic in St. Augustine, Florida.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>Animal Emergency needed a new website that stood out from their competitors, reflected their new branding and allowed frazzled pet owners to find information about caring for their pet and contacting the practice quickly.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>I created a professional website that draws in pet owners and makes them feel comfortable trusting their pet to Animal Emergency Hospital. The photo on the top banner changes with each page, showcasing different types of pets. Each navigation link is preceded by a paw print for added personality and the copy on each page emphasizes readability.</p>
