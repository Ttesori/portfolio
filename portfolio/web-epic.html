		<h3>The Client</h3>
		<p><em><a href="http://epicuniverse.com" target="_blank">Epic Universe</a></em> is a series of books published by author Lee Stephen. A sci-fi series for lovers of Halo and Star Wars, the author loves the epic feel of those all-time greats.</p>

			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>Most websites for self-published authors look, well, a little DIY. Lee wanted his website to have a &#8220;big-screen blockbuster&#8221; kind of feel and draw in an audience that aren&#8217;t conventional readers.</p>

			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>On<em> Epic Universe&#8217;s</em> new website, Lee&#8217;s custom artwork jumps off the page, his varied content resonates clearly and the whole thing certainly feels more &#8220;video game&#8221; than book!</p>
