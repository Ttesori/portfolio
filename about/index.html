			<h1>About Me</h1>
			
			<p>The story of my geekery starts way back in 1996, when we brought home our first computer. After excitedly connecting to the Internet (via dialup, of course), I zoomed straight to Geocities and hastily built my first website.</p>
			<figure><img src="/img/photos/about-geocities.jpg" alt="Geocities Screenshot, circa 1996"><figcaption>Yup, *that* GeoCities (circa 1996)</figcaption></figure>
			<p>Foolishly proud of my creation, 11-year-old me submitted it to a design competition...and the review was scathing. Looking back, I suppose my use of blue and green text on a black background wasn’t the best choice, but that criticism made me determined to learn everything I could about proper design.

			<h2>Design Foundations</h2>

			<p>As yearbook editor, high school was my first introduction to real-world design (I don't think X-Files collages made in Paint Shop Pro count). With up-to-date technology in hand (namely teal iMacs with PageMaker and Photoshop 6), I was amazed at the design possibilities opened up to me. In three years, I learned an invaluable amount as I ensured every page was pixel&mdash;err pica&mdash;perfect.</p>

			<p>There was no turning back now: design would be my path!</p>

			<h2>Shifting Perspectives</h2>

			<p>Through my college studies (as well as my time in the workforce), both my design sense and perspective have matured. I now understand that, more than being aesthetically pleasing, all design must effectively achieve its communication goals. Nothing is gained from a confusing mess of content (no matter how beautifully it is displayed!).</p>

			<p>As a result, I now spend more time in planning and preparation, before my pen ever touches paper (or my mouse creates a new document).</p>

			<h2>Personal Randomness</h2>
			<figure><img src="/img/photos/about-mestaug.jpg" alt="Me in my hometown of St. Augustine, FL"><figcaption>Me in beautiful, sunny St. Augustine</figcaption></figure>
			<p>I live (very happily) in my hometown of St. Augustine, Florida, with my husband and preschooler, who keep me loving, laughing and going to sleep at 9pm every single night. I love cooking, canning, and making soap (I know, I’m such a cool 30-something!). I never miss an episode of Doctor Who, iZombie and Game of Thrones...as well as one or two guilty pleasures (*coughMarriedAtFirstSightcough*).</p>

			<p>Beyond all that, I’m just a simple geeky chick whose encyclopedic knowledge of late-90’s boy bands scares even myself.</p>

			<h2>Keep Learning, Keep Growing</h2>

			<p>Above all else, my biggest goal in life is continuous learning. I’m continually hunting new technologies and improved methods for doing what I love. With the pace of change in the design/development world, I that'll keep me busy for a good long while!</p>
