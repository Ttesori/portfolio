		<h3>The Client</h3>
		<p>Duolit, a self-publishing and book marketing blog I ran with a close friend for over five years.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>The blog had over 500 posts and pages of content, so a clean and organized site was a must. Duolit also needed to drive folks toward the Weekend Book Marketing Makeover, which readers received for free after signing up for their mailing list.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>Duolitâ€™s blog is colorful but uncluttered, showcasing their best content and driving email signups by featuring a callout box on every page.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
			<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
			<p>Wordpress, HTML, CSS</p>
